      # in your code
      use HTML::ValidationRules;
      my $parser = HTML::ValidationRules->new;
      my $rules  = $parser->load_rules(file => 'form.html');

      # rules will be extracted as follows:
      [
          text     => [ [ HTML_PATTERN => '[[:alnum:]]+' ], [ HTML_MAXLENGTH => 255 ] ],
          url      => [ HTML_URL    => [ HTML_MAXLENGTH => 255 ], 'HTML_REQUIRED'     ],
          email    => [ HTML_EMAIL  => [ HTML_MAXLENGTH => 255 ], 'HTML_REQUIRED'     ],
          number   => [ HTML_NUMBER => [ HTML_MIN => 200 ], [ HTML_MAX => 800 ]       ],
          textarea => [ [ HTML_MAXLENGTH => 1000 ], 'HTML_REQUIRED'                   ],
      ]

      # then use the rules with, for example, FormValidator::Simple
      use FormValidator::Simple qw(HTML);

      my $query  = CGI->new;
      my $result = FormValidator::Simple->check($query => $rules);
